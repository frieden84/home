              (1) RegCheck: Program analysis for regulatory compliance assessment of FinTech Software [March 2023 – February 2025] </br>
              RegCheck aims to derive privacy rules from GDPR and verify whether software artifacts (e.g.,
              source codes) of FinTech applications (e.g., online banking) properly implement such rules to
              be compliant with GDPR. The PI’s previous work within ARTAGO project is relevant and
              complementary to RegCheck. Drawing on her previous work, the PI will contribute to the
              creation of privacy rules from GDPR.

            (2) AFRICA: Automated Financial Regulations change Impact Analysis [May 2023 – June
            2025] </br>
              AFRICA aims to (semi-)automatically detect the change in the landscape of financial
              regulations and analyze the impact of this change on the compliance process, notably in
              various software artifacts (e.g., NL requirements) of financial applications. The project will
              further provide recommendations to address the detected changes and remain compliant. The
              PI will contribute to the development of the automated solutions in AFRICA.

            <p>(3) RUMOFA: Runtime monitoring of fund activities [May 2023 – June 2025] </br>
              RUMOFA aims to automatically monitor and verify the financial transaction records against the
              financial requirements. The project will rely on NLP technologies to process and extract
              meaningful information from the financial regulations and fund documents to enable verifying
              fund activities in real-time. The PI will be involved in the information extraction phase and will
              investigate innovative methods to transform the extracted information into some intermediate
              format that can be used in the runtime monitoring.

              (4) ICCOFIDO: Incremental compliance checking of financial documents activities [May
              2023 – June 2025] </br>
              ICCOFIDO aims to detect the temporal changes in financial documents (prospectuses) which
              are likely to impact the compliance process. ICCOFIDO will develop automated means for
              checking compliance incrementally, i.e., accounting for the changes across multiple revisions
              of the same document and further assessing these changes against the compliance rules
              derived from the financial regulations. The PI will contribute to developing automated solutions
              for detecting temporal changes in prospectuses and analyzing the detected change on their
              compliance.

              PLAITO: Automated Completeness Enhancement of Requirements towards Improved Trustworthiness [September 2024 - August 2027] </br>
              Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming business and industry, including software development practices. To foster the
economic and social benefits of AI, regulations are being enforced to ensure that the development, deployment, and use of
AI is trustworthy, i.e., ethical, lawful, and robust. Trustworthiness in modern software systems (e.g., AI-enabled software)
should be addressed in the upstream stages of software development, mainly requirements engineering (RE). RE is
concerned with introducing quality assurance measures to ensure that the software qualifies as trustworthy. With modern
software becoming more complex, traditional techniques for quality assurance in RE should be revisited and revamped.
PLAITO provides a new perspective on enhancing the completeness of natural-language (NL) requirements, with an
emphasis on diversity and non-discrimination ethical concerns. To detect incompleteness violations, PLAITO will put
forward a technical approach that employs recent artificial intelligence technologies, including natural language processing
(NLP) and machine learning (ML). More concretely, PLAITO investigates the powerful capability of large-scale language
models (LLMs) in language understanding and generation. Building on the extensive knowledge of LLMs, PLAITO will
develop automated solutions that can expand the current view of engineers and pinpoint the potentially missing content in
the existing requirements. PLAITO will investigate the possibility of utilizing LLMs for automatically generating user stories
that describe diverse users and their needs. The automatically generated user stories will be used to detect incomplete
and/or missing requirements which should capture diverse users’ needs. PLAITO will further complement the research
agenda of responsible NLP by empirically evaluating both the effectiveness of several LLMs in generating in-domain textual
requirements, and the sustainability of LLMs in terms of their energy consumption. A successful completion of PLAITO will
present an important academic advance in the field of requirements engineering and at the same time provide several
avenues for industrial exploitation.
